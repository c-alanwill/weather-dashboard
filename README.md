# Weather Dashboard

## Description

* The repository shows an application for a weather dashboard where the user can search for a city and display the current weather in addition to a five day forecast of weather for that city.  This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery.  It has a responsive user interface to be laid out properly on various size screens.

* The user types a city in the search field and upon selecting the "submit" button, the city's current weather shows in a text area to the right.  Below that text area, are 5 cards.  The first card shows the forecast for the next day.  Then the next four cards show the forecast for the next four days after that.  For the selected city, the card lists the city name, the date, and the futre forecast for the temperature in farenheit, wind speed in MPH, and the humidity.

* In addition to searching for a city, there are favorite cities listed under the search field.  When a user selects a favorite city, the current forecast and the five day forecast will be shown for that city, the same as if the user searched for the city.

* The application uses local storage to store persistent data.

* The HTML code contains a logical structure for the elements within the page.  There are sections within the body for each section on the page.

* The project uses Bootstrap with a link shown on the head section of the HTML.  There is also linked CSS stylesheet in the head section of the HTML. 

* Also, the project uses JQuery and Moments.js with links under the script tag on the HTML page.  There is a linked Javascipt file as well under the script tag.

* The application makes requests and retrieves data from the third party API, openweathermap.org, to show the resulting weather details. 


* Notes have been applied to the HTML code, CSS and JavaScript code to identify each section of code.
